	on the channel; hence, it can be estimated based on run-time measurements.
	Second, we show that the estimation of n, based on exponential smoothing
	of the measured collision probability (specifically, an ARMA filter),
	results to be a biased estimation, with poor performance in terms
	of accuracy/tracking trade-offs. Third, we propose a methodology
	to estimate n, based on an extended Kalman filter coupled with a
	change detection mechanism. This approach shows both high accuracy
	as well as prompt reactivity to changes in the network occupancy
	status. Numerical results show that, although devised in the assumption
	of saturated terminals, our proposed approach results effective also
	in non-saturated conditions, and specifically in tracking the average

	on the cusum and cusum of squares of recursive residuals are developed.
	Further techniques based on moving regressions, in which the regression
	model is fitted from a segment of data which is moved along the series,
	and on regression models whose coefficients are polynomials in time
	are studied. The Quandt log-likelihood ratio statistic is considered.
	Emphasis is placed on the use of graphical methods. The techniques
	proposed have been embodied in a comprehensive computer program,
	TIMVAR. Use of the techniques is illustrated by applying them to

	linear, quadratic, or other regression functions. This segmental semi-Markov
	model is an extension
	
	of the standard hidden Markov model (HMM), from which learning and

	extended. Results on both simulated and real data from semiconductor

	Begins with distinction between Markov Models and Semi-Markov models
	(semi allow time before state change to have any distribution not
	just geometric).
	
	Then a general model is formulated where the hidden states \{s1,...s_n\}
	are assumed to follow a semi-markov process. Observations are generated
	according
	
	to y_t = f_t(t | \theta_i) + \epsilon_t, where \theta_i is a parameter
	corresponding to the state we are in. They consider a model with
	a single change point (ie two
	
	values of theta) and then use EM to estimate \theta_1 and \theta_2.
	Once these are estimated, the Viterbi (forwards-backwards) algorithm
	is used to find the most
	
	probable change point.
	
	
	This approach is then tested on a very artificial dataset (which is
	interesting and I could use it later) and a real world one. It is
	compared against a segmentation

  pages = {xiv+784},

  abstract = {``We won't comment here on the long history of the book, which is
	recounted in [E. L. Lehmann, Statist. Sci. 12 (1997), no. 1, 48--52;
	MR1466430], but shall use this Preface to indicate the principal
	changes from the second edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical
	hypotheses, Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406 (87j:62001)].
	``The present volume is divided into two parts. Part I (Chapters
	1--10) treats small-sample theory, while Part II (Chapters 11--15)
	treats large-sample theory. The preface to the second edition stated
	that `the most important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality
	paralleling that given for estimation in the companion volume [E.
	L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point estimation, Second edition,
	Springer, New York, 1998; MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy
	this failure by treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality
	(in Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for this
	purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed these tools, we
	use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of
	goodness of fit than was possible in the second edition, and in Chapter
	15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques.
	Various large-sample considerations that in the second edition were
	discussed in earlier chapters now have been moved to Chapter 11.
	
	``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment of multiple
	testing including some recent optimality results. This topic is now
	presented in Chapter 9. In order to make room for these extensive
	additions, we had to eliminate some material found in the second
	edition, primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear hypothesis.
	
	``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a detailed knowledge
	of small-sample theory is not required for Part II. In particular,
	the necessary background should include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5,
	3.8--3.9; Chapter 4: Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3;
	Chapter 6, Sections 6.1--6.2; Chapter 7, Sections 7.1--7.2; Chapter
	8, Sections 8.1--8.2, 8.4--8.5.'' },

	Begins with a definition of sequential hypothesis testing, followed
	by introducing the SLRT. The Wald appproximations for Type 1/II errors
	as functions of 
	
	SLRT barriers are derived. A lot of time is then spent on a complex
	derivation of the expected number of observations needed to make
	a decision. The problem
	
	of complex is then introduced, and dealt with simply by the observation
	that to test H_0: x=0 against H_1: x > 1, we replace H_1 with H_2:
	x = v where 'v'
	
	is the minimum change magnitude we are interested in detection.},
