     \title{Creates a CPM S4 Object}
     \author{Gordon J. Ross \email{gordon.ross03@imperial.ac.uk}}
     \description{
       This function is used to create a change point model (CPM) S4 object. The CPM object can be used to process a sequence of data, one observation at a time. The CPM object maintains its state between each observation, and can be queried to obtain the \code{D_{k,t}} statistics, and to test whether a change has been detected. 
       
           Note that this function is part of the S4 object section of the \code{cpm} package, which allows for more precise control over the change detection process. For many simple change detection applications this extra complexity will not be required, and the \code{detectChangePoint} and \code{processStream} functions should be used instead.
           
	For a fuller overview of this function including a description of the CPM framework and examples of how to use the various functions, please use \code{vignette("cpm")}

     makeChangePointModel(cpmType, ARL0=500, startup=20, lambda=NA) 
     }
     \arguments{
       \item{cpmType}{The type of CPM which is to be created. Possible arguments are: 
         \itemize{
           \item \code{Student}: Student-t test statistic, as in [Hawkins et al, 2003]. Use to detect mean changes in a Gaussian sequence.
           \item \code{Bartlett}: Bartlett test statistic, as in [Hawkins and Zamba, 2005]. Use to detect variance changes in a Gaussian sequence.
           \item \code{GLR}: Generalized Likelihood Ratio test statistic, as in [Hawkins and Zamba, 2005b]. Use to detect both mean and variance changes in a Gaussian sequence.
            \item \code{Exponential}: Generalized Likelihood Ratio test statistic for the Exponential distribution, as in [Ross, 2013]. Used to detect changes in the parameter of an Exponentially distributed sequence.
           \item \code{GLRAdjusted} and \code{ExponentialAdjusted}: Identical to the GLR and Exponential statistics, except with the finite-sample correction discussed in [Ross, 2013] which can lead to more powerful change detection.
           \item \code{FET}: Fishers Exact Test statistic, as in [Ross and Adams, 2012b]. Use to detect parameter changes in a Bernoulli sequence.
           \item \code{Mann-Whitney}: Mann-Whitney test statistic, as in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect location shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \code{Mood}: Mood test statistic, as in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect scale shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \code{Lepage}: Lepage test statistics in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect location and/or shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \code{Kolmogorov-Smirnov}: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, as in [Ross et al 2012]. Use to detect arbitrary changes in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \code{Cramer-von-Mises}: Cramer-von-Mises test statistic, as in [Ross et al 2012]. Use to detect arbitrary changes in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
         }
         
    	}     
       \item{ARL0}{Determines the \eqn{ARL_0} which the CPM should have, which corresponds to the average number of observations before a false positive occurs, assuming that the sequence does not undergo a chang. Because the thresholds of the CPM are computationally expensive to estimate, the package contains pre-computed values of the thresholds corresponding to several common values of the \eqn{ARL_0}. This means that only certain  values for the \eqn{ARL_0} are allowed. Specifically, the \eqn{ARL_0} must have one of the following values: 370, 500, 600, 700, ..., 1000, 2000, 3000, ..., 10000, 20000, ..., 50000.}
       \item{startup}{The number of observations after which monitoring begins. No change points will be flagged during this startup period. This must be set to at least 20.}
       \item{lambda}{A smoothing parameter which is used to reduce the discreteness of the test statistic when using the FET CPM. See [Ross and Adams, 2012b] in the References section for more details on how this parameter is used.  Currently the package only contains sequences of ARL0 thresholds corresponding to lambda=0.1 and lambda=0.3, so using other values will result in an error. If no value is specified, the default value will be 0.1.}

     \value{
       A CPM S4 object. The class of this object will depend on the value which has been passed as the \code{cpmType} argument.
