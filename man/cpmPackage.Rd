\description{An implementation of several different change point models (CPMs) for performing both parametric and nonparametric change detection on univariate data streams.}
\details{The CPM framework is an approach to sequential change detection (also known as Phase II process monitoring) which allows standard statistical hypothesis tests to be deployed sequentially. The main two general purpose functions in the package are \code{detectChangePoint} and \code{processStream} for detecting single and multiple change points respectively. The remainder of the functions allow for more precise control over the change detection procedure.

A Brief CPM Overview

Given a sequence \eqn{X_1,...,X_n} of random variables, the CPM works by evaluating a two-sample test statistic at every possible split point. Let \eqn{D_{k,n}} be the value of the test statistic when the sequence is split into the two samples \eqn{\{X_1, X_2,..., X_k\}} and \eqn{\{X_{k+1}, X_{k+2} ,..., X_{n}\}},  and define \eqn{D_n} to be the maximum of these values. \eqn{D_n} is then compared to some threshold, with a change being detected if the threshold is exceeded. 

In the sequential context, the observations are processed one-by-one, with \eqn{D_t} being computed based on the first \emph{t} observations, \eqn{D_{t+1}} being computed based on the first \emph{t+1} observations, and so on. The change detection time is defined as the first value of \eqn{t} where the threshold is exceeded. Supposing this occurs at time \eqn{t=T}, then the best estimate of the location of the change point is the value of \eqn{k} which maximised \eqn{D_{k,T}}. Writing \eqn{\hat{\tau}} for this, we have that \eqn{\hat{\tau} \leq T}.

The thresholds are chosen so that there is a constant probability of a false positive occurring after each observation. This leads to control of the Average Run Length (\eqn{ARL_0}), defined as the expected number of observations received before a change is falsely detecting, assuming that no change has occurred.

The choice of test statistic in the CPM defines the class of changes which it is optimised towards detecting. This package implements CPMs using the following statistics. More details can be found in the references section:

\itemize{
           \item \emph{Student}: Student-t test statistic, as in [Hawkins et al, 2003]. Use to detect mean changes in a Gaussian sequence.
           \item \emph{Bartlett}: Bartlett test statistic, as in [Hawkins and Zamba, 2005]. Use to detect variance changes in a Gaussian sequence.
           \item \code{GLR}: Generalized Likelihood Ratio test statistic, as in [Hawkins and Zamba, 2005b]. Use to detect both mean and variance changes in a Gaussian sequence.
           \item \code{Exponential}: Generalized Likelihood Ratio test statistic for the Exponential distribution, as in [Ross, 2013]. Used to detect changes in the parameter of an Exponentially distributed sequence.
           \item \code{GLRAdjusted} and \code{ExponentialAdjusted}: Identical to the GLR and Exponential statistics, except with the finite-sample correction discussed in [Ross, 2013] which can lead to more powerful change detection.
           \item \emph{FET}: Fishers Exact Test statistic, as in [Ross and Adams, 2012b]. Use to detect parameter changes in a Bernoulli sequence.
           \item \emph{Mann-Whitney}: Mann-Whitney test statistic, as in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect location shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \emph{Mood}: Mood test statistic, as in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect scale shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \emph{Lepage}: Lepage test statistics in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect location and/ort shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \emph{Kolmogorov-Smirnov}: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, as in [Ross et al 2012]. Use to detect arbitrary changes in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
           \item \emph{Cramer-von-Mises}: Cramer-von-Mises test statistic, as in [Ross et al 2012]. Use to detect arbitrary changes in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.
